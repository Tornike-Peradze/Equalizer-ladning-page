## My process

### Built with

- HTML: Used for creating the structure and elements of the web page.
  CSS: Applied styles to enhance the visual presentation and layout of the order summary card.
- Visual Studio Code: A powerful and popular code editor that provided a convenient and efficient development environment.
- Frontend Mentor: The project was completed as part of a challenge provided by Frontend Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/). Frontend Mentor offers a range of real-life coding challenges to help developers practice their skills and improve their front-end development abilities.

The Equalizer landing page is built using HTML and CSS, which are fundamental web development technologies. HTML is used to structure the content and define the different sections of the page, while CSS is utilized to style and layout the elements. The CSS properties and selectors are applied to achieve the desired visual effects and ensure consistency across the page.

In addition to HTML and CSS, you may have used various assets such as images, logos, and icons to enhance the visual presentation. These assets are referenced within the HTML using the <img> tag and linked in the CSS using the url() function.

To enhance the design and typography, you may have utilized external fonts provided by Google Fonts or other sources. These fonts are imported into the CSS using the @import rule, and then applied to the appropriate elements using the font-family property.

To achieve responsiveness, you have utilized media queries in CSS to apply different styles based on the screen size and orientation. This allows the page layout to adapt and provide an optimized viewing experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

Overall, the Equalizer landing page demonstrates your ability to combine HTML and CSS effectively to create a visually appealing and responsive webpage that effectively communicates the key features and benefits of the app.

### What I learned

Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable knowledge and skills. Here are some key things I learned:

- HTML structure: I gained experience in creating the structure of a web page using HTML. I learned how to organize elements such as headings, paragraphs, and div containers to establish the layout of the order summary card.

- CSS styling: I learned how to apply CSS styles to enhance the visual presentation of the order summary card. This included styling text, backgrounds, borders, and utilizing CSS selectors and properties to achieve the desired design.

### Continued development

I aspire to dive deeper into CSS and explore more advanced techniques and concepts. This includes mastering CSS Grid, learning CSS animations and transitions, and exploring responsive design patterns to create truly dynamic and interactive user interfaces. With the increasing use of mobile devices, it's crucial to create websites that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes. I want to focus on mastering responsive design principles and adopting a mobile-first approach, ensuring that my projects are accessible and provide a great user experience across all devices.
